I mostly write **Python//SQL** these days. Here are a few interesting **projects** that worth mentioning:

- [Assignments_for Analyst position](https://github.com/bebyakinb/test_assignments_Analyst) - some test assignment for Product Analyst position
- [CPP_Piscine](https://github.com/bebyakinb/CPP_Piscine) - An intensive C++ piscine (course)
- [CUB3D](https://github.com/bebyakinb/cub3D) - First-person 3D representation of a maze using raycasting, similar to Wolfenstein 3D (1992).
- [minishell](https://github.com/bebyakinb/minishell) - It's a minimum viable version of a real shell. The main goal is to have a good understanding of process creation and synchronisation using the C programmming language.
- [ft_server](https://github.com/bebyakinb/ft_server) - Sys-Admin project. The aim is to discover Docker and setup a webserver.
- [ft_services](https://github.com/bebyakinb/ft_services) - Webserver cluster running with Docker containers and Kubernetes
